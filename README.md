# beamerthemes
A collection of Beamer themes

## Zaragoza theme

A minimalistic-yet-elegant theme for general use. The elements are encapsulated in colored rectangles delimited by white lines. The title page contains the title, subtitle, author and date at the bottom, leaving the top for institutional logos. In the content pages, the header and footer are as narrow as possible, leaving plenty of room for your very important stuff. The current and total page number are located at the left corner of the header, next to the frame title. The footer contains the short versions of the name, title and date (so noone forgets what you're talking about!)

## Unizar color theme

A color theme based on the institutional blue from [University of Zaragoza](http://unizar.es/), as well as a darker and a lighter shades.
