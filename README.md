A collection of Beamer themes

## Zaragoza theme

A minimalistic-yet-elegant theme for general use. The elements are encapsulated in colored rectangles delimited by white lines. The title page contains the title, subtitle, author and date at the bottom, leaving the top for institutional logos. In the content pages, the header and footer are as narrow as possible, leaving plenty of room for your very important stuff. The current and total page number are located at the left corner of the header, next to the frame title. The footer contains the short versions of the name, title and date (so noone forgets what you're talking about!)

`\titlepagelogoA{}` inserts a logo in the top left corner of the title page

`\titlepagelogoB{}` inserts a logo in the top right corner of the title page


## UZ theme

A theme based on the [institutional slide template](https://unizar.es/identidad-corporativa/identidad-corporativa) from University of Zaragoza. It features a huge logo in the title page and a rather big three-line footer with a small logo in content pages. I moved the title from the footer on the first page, because there wasn't really enough place.

`\titlepagelogo{}` inserts a logo in the center of the title page
`\footerlogo{}` inserts a logo in the right side of the footer
`\framesubtitle{}` used to create two-colour frame titles

## Unizar color theme

A color theme based on the institutional blue from [University of Zaragoza](http://unizar.es/), as well as a darker and a lighter shades.

`palette primary` White text on medium blue background
